turnin id:  os_p3

Write a program that will accept input like the obj files in the
p3.testfiles directory.  Note that the obj files correspond to asm
files there also.  The obj files are the "same" format as your output
for p2.  However, note that the address operand for opcodes that take
a single operand is in the third word.  For example, this line:
    JLT     TOP
might generate output something like this:
    T 33 23 0 21    <--- note 2nd word = 0 and addr of TOP is in 3rd word
    R 35

The program should implement the virtual machine described in the
Machine Specs of the langdef.txt file that we have used for reference
in past assignments.

The program should accept two command-line arguments:
    filename_to_load
    load_point
Load the contents of the file at the specified location in your virtual machine.
Then, execute the loaded program.  The only things that should print are the 
results of the print instructions:  PINT and PREGS
    

Requirements:
    1.  use turnin to submit a tar file
    2.  the tar file must contain:
            a.  c/c++/python source program
            b.  makefile that builds a default target named p3 by simply
                typing the command 'make'
            c.  if the program is in python, it must contain the correct
                #! first line and the makefile must copy it to a file named
                p3 and p3 must be marked as executable using:  chmod +x p3
    3.  p3 will be run by typing:
            ./p3 FILENAME LOADPT
        where FILENAME is the name of a file containing an obj file, and
        where LOADPT is the load point for the object program.
