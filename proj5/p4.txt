turnin id:  os_p4

Enhance p3 such that your machine can run 2 processes at once, using multiprogramming.

The program should accept four command-line arguments:
    filename_to_load_1
    load_point_1
    filename_to_load_2
    load_point_2

The program should load two object programs at the specified load points.  Then,
the machine should begin to execute the first program.  After 2 instructions of
interpreting program 1, switch to executing program 2 and run it for 2 instructions,
and then back to program 1, etc.
    

As usual:
    1.  use turnin to submit a tar file
    2.  the tar file must contain:
            a.  c/c++/python source program
            b.  makefile that builds a default target named p4 by simply
                typing the command 'make'
            c.  if the program is in python, it must contain the correct
                #! first line and the makefile must copy it to a file named
                p4 and p4 must be marked as executable using:  chmod +x p4
