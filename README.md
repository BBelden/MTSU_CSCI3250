# 3250

## description

**proj1** contains a program that implements pass 1 of an assembler for the language described in the langdef.txt file.

**proj2** contains a program that enhances p1 by implementing pass 2 of an assembler.

**proj3** contains a program that enhances p2 by implementing the virtual machine described in the machine specs of the langdef.txt file.

**proj4** contains a program that enhances p3 so that the "machine" can run two processes at once.

**proj5** WOULD have contained a program that enhanced p3 (not p4) so that the "machine" could have a virtual address spess 4 times the size of real memory. I believe the file is lost because the prof dropped the lowest project score, but we'll never know, will we?
