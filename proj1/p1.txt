turnin id:  os_p1

Write a program that implements pass 1 of an assembler for the language
described in the langdef.txt file.

Requirements:
    1.  use turnin to submit a tar file
    2.  the tar file must contain:
            a.  c/c++/python source program
            b.  makefile that builds a default target named p1 by simply
                typing the command 'make'
            c.  if the program is in python, it must contain the correct
                #! first line and the makefile must copy it to a file named
                p1 and p1 must be marked as executable using:  chmod +x p1
    3.  p1 must run by typing:
            ./p1 FILENAME
        where FILENAME is the name of a file containing a program in our
        assembly language
    4.  p1 must print the symbol table to standard output in this format:
            symbol  location_in_decimal  rel/abs

For example, for this input:

    R0      EQU   0
            LA    1,1
    LABEL1  ST    1,I1
            ST    1,I2
    LABEL2  EQU   99
            PINT  2,DATA
            J     LABEL3
    DATA    INTZ  12
    END     EQU   DATA+12  # DATA can not be fwd ref
            ORG   DATA     # DATA can not be fwd ref
    I1      INTU  1
    I2      INTU  1
            ORG   END      # END can not be fwd ref
    LABEL3  HALT

the program would print this output:

    R0       0  abs
    LABEL1   3  rel
    LABEL2  99  abs
    DATA    15  rel
    END     27  rel
    I1      15  rel
    I2      16  rel
    LABEL3  27  rel
